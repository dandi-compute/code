# DANDI Compute: Orchestration code

Contains essential code for orchestrating computation submission and queue management for processing pipelines acting on DANDI assets.



## Manual dispatch commands on MIT Engaging

To run manually with confirmation to trigger (for debugging):

```bash
dandicompute aind prepare --id [full content ID]
```

To run automatically:

```bash
dandicompute aind prepare --id [full content ID] --submit
```

To test automatically on the example asset:

```bash
dandicompute prepare test --queue ./queue
```

To clean unsubmitted job capsules:

```bash
dandicompute queue clean --queue ./queue/ --dandiset ./dandi/001697/
```

To archive a failed job capsule by moving it from `001697` to the permanent archive `001873`:

```bash
dandicompute archive job --path derivatives/dandiset-000409/sub-mouse01/pipeline-aind+ephys/version-v1.0_params-default_config-abc123_attempt-1
```

The capsule subtree is downloaded into a scratch directory, uploaded to `001873`, and only then deleted from `001697`. The scratch directory is cleaned up on success. A failed upload never removes the original.

To check whether there is any queued work before dispatching, use `queue pending`. It exits with code 0 when at least one job is awaiting submission, and code 1 when there is nothing to process. This lets a crontab skip the dispatch entirely when the queue is empty:

```bash
dandicompute queue pending --silent && dandicompute queue process --queue ./queue/ --processing ./processing/
```



## Contributing Non-Code Files

Non-code files for the AIND ephys pipeline are organized under the following subdirectories of `src/dandi_compute_code/aind_ephys_pipeline/`:

- **`templates/`** — Jinja2 submission script templates (e.g., `submission_template.txt`).
  Add a new `.txt` template here and reference it via `_globals.py` or a new globals module.

- **`params/`** — JSON parameter files passed to the pipeline (e.g., `default.json`, `no_motion.json`).
  To add a new parameters file:
  1. Add the `[id].json` file to this directory.
  2. Register it in `registries/registered_params.json` by adding an entry with the short name as the key, and its relative `path` and full MD5 `md5` as values, e.g.:
     ```json
     "my+params": {
       "path": "my_params.json",
       "md5": "<md5 hash of the file>"
     }
     ```
  The short name can then be passed via the `parameters_key` argument in `_prepare_job.py` or via `--params` on the CLI.

- **`registries/`** — JSON registry files mapping short names to resource paths and checksums (e.g., `registered_params.json`).

- **`configs/`** — Nextflow configuration files for a specific compute environment (e.g., `mit_engaging.config`).
  To add a new config file:
  1. Add the `[environment].config` file to this directory.
  2. Register it in `registries/registered_configs.json` by adding an entry with the short name as the key, and its relative `path` and full MD5 `md5` as values.
  Use `--config` / `config_key` to select a registered config (default: `default`).
