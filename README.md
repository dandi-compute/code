# DANDI Compute (Code)

Contains essential code for performing computations on DANDI assets.


## Dandiset `001697` Layout

The outer level of the Dandiset is organized according to a [BIDS-Study](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#study-dataset) layout.

The `sourcedata` contains only a single unique file: the AIND testing sample. This is used for testing and demonstration purposes.

The primary `derivatives` directory follows the [Type 1 BIDS-Derivatives](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#storage-of-derived-datasets) structure with nested derivative directories.

It contains one subdirectory per compute pipeline, starting with `pipeline-aind+ephys`.

Each `pipeline-[identifier]/derivatives` directory contains a subdirectory for each unique asset processed.

Each asset directory contains subdirectories for each unique result generated by different configuration options.

The contents of each `asset-[identifier]/results-[identifier]` directory follow [Type 2 BIDS-Derivatives](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#storage-of-derived-datasets) standalone dataset style.

The `dataset_description.json` of each result directory contains the provenance information regarding the pipeline used to generate that output.
