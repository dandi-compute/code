    Fetch the list of content IDs that currently qualify for the LFP pipeline.

    The remote cache is a JSON Lines file where each line is a single-entry
    ``{content_id: qualifies}`` object (``qualifies`` is a ``bool``). The LFP cache
    is the looser superset of the AIND cache. The lines are merged into one mapping
    and only the content IDs whose value is ``True`` are returned.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the mapping cannot be downloaded or decoded from the remote URL.
        The original exception is chained via ``raise ... from``.
