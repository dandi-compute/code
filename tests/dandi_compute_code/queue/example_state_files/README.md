# Example queue state

`state.tsv` is a single static example of a queue `state.tsv` file.
It is the shared ground truth for the queue test suite.

Each row is one job capsule, matching the format produced by `QueueState.to_tsv` and consumed by `QueueState.from_tsv`.
Tests load the file through the fixtures in `../conftest.py` and select the entry they need by its `dandi_path`, which is named to describe the scenario it covers.
Rows that share a `dandi_path` are told apart by their `config`.

The empty-queue case is written inline by the few tests that need it rather than kept as a file.

The point in the job lifecycle is encoded by the presence flags:

- pending: `has_code` and not `has_been_submitted`, with no logs or output yet
- stalled: `has_been_submitted` but no logs or output ever appeared
- running: `has_logs` and not `has_output`
- successful: `has_output`
- failed: `has_code` and `has_logs` and not `has_output`

| `dandi_path` | Scenario |
| --- | --- |
| `sub-pending` | Prepared but never submitted. |
| `sub-successful` | Output present, with a known source-asset size (120 bytes). |
| `sub-failed/ses-one` and `sub-failed/ses-two` | Two capsules with logs but no output (the running/failed state), reaching `max_fail_per_dandiset` for Dandiset 000001 (both mapped to `asset-aaa`). |
| `sub-fresh` (Dandiset 000002) | A queued asset in another Dandiset with no failures (mapped to `asset-bbb`). |
| `sub-sole/ses-capsule` (Dandiset 001371) | The sole capsule in its pipeline/version tree, so empty parents are pruned on removal. Also covers the legacy nested layout. |
| `sub-two/ses-capsules` (configs `cfgtwoa` and `cfgtwob`) | The `cfgtwoa` capsule is queued and the `cfgtwob` one is completed, so the shared parent is kept after the queued capsule is removed. |
| `sub-already/ses-submitted` | Queued in state, but a submitted marker exists on disk, so it is left alone. |
| `sourcedata/sub-test+bids` (Dandiset 001849) | A queued capsule whose recorded `dandi_path` differs from the on-disk layout, exercising fallback capsule-directory resolution. |
| `sub-stalled/ses-one` and `sub-stalled/ses-two` | Two capsules submitted to the scheduler with no logs or output ever appearing (the stalled state), both mapped to `asset-ccc`. |
